### Pushing Your Contributions

Thank you for making it this far! If you would be so kind as to update the version number, that way my GH actions, and Kubernetes can have auto-deployment so your amazing contribution doesn't have to wait for me to be seen by the world!

You can easily change version by running `make minor` or `make major` depending on how big of a change it is. Kubernetes doesn't care which one has changed. Neither do I.

If you don't have Python, changing the version is in 2 steps.

    1. Update version in `version.txt`
    2. Update version in `kubernetes/app_deploy.yaml` on line 21
